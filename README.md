# Airbnb Data Warehousing project

##About the Project
This project aims to design and implement a Data Warehouse that integrates data from two different sources, Airbnb bookings data for Seattle and data on crimes committed in city. The extract, transform and load (ETL) process is executed in Python and MS SQL and SQL queries are performed to analyse the effect of crime in a neighbourhood on the rental prices and occupation rates of Airbnb. The results are visualised in Tableau. 

This [Presentation Link](https://rishikak1704.github.io/AirbnbDataWarehousing/ "Presentation Link") documents the data warehouse schema, ETL process, SQL queries and Tableau visualizations.
